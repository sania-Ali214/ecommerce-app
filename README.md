Styling
The app uses custom CSS in App.css to create a stylish and modern look:

Colors: A blue theme (#4a90e2) with gradients and contrasting accents.
Effects: Hover animations, box shadows, and smooth transitions.
Layout: Grid and flexbox for a responsive and organized structure.
Typography: The Inter font (via Google Fonts or fallback) for a clean appearance.

To customize the design, edit App.css and adjust colors, shadows, or layouts as needed.
